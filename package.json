  "description": "This is a prototype to explore the idea of using a Service Worker for intercepting `fetch` requests and rerouting them through an [iframe with an alternative origin (Origin Isolation)](https://github.com/ForgeRock/appAuthHelper/blob/master/origin_isolation.md). By leveraging an iframe on an alternative origin, we are able to store the tokens using the standard Web Storage API while also keeping them completely inaccessible to the main application.",
